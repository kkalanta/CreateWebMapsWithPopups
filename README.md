# Create Web Maps with Custom Popups
ArcGIS API for Python version 1.8.4 is used to develop current script. The script was tested against ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7.1. 

Current Python script includes steps to create a web map from feature layer collection and define custom popups for operational layers of web map. Two modules of arcgis.gis and arcgis.mapping of ArcGIS API for Python are utilized in the script. In addition to HTML format, the popup function uses names or labels of fields in feature layers. It changes the color, font type, and font size of description in popups and defines decimal places and digit separators in numeric fields.
